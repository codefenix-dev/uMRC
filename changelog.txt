Change Log:

v095 - December 7, 2025:

  - Shortened the displayable text input area by one character, as it was
    causing some terminals to drag it up the screen while typing strings
    longer than the terminal width.    
  - Fix for NOTME messages announcing users joining rooms the user is not
    in.


v094 - December 6, 2025:

  Changes:
  
  - Fixed some nasty text input issues that happen when % symbols appear
    in the chat text or input text, or when cycling through colors for 
    lines longer than the input area.
  - Basic errors written to a log file named "umrc.log".
  - Optional verbose logging can be enabled with -V command line switch.
  - Reset mention counter to 0 when user leaves chat.
  - Fix for messages not getting line-wrapped while chat is paused in 
    scrollback mode.
  

v093 - December 5, 2025:

  Changes:
        
  - Added /theme chat command. User types /theme by itself to list the 
    available themes, or includes the name of theme as a parameter to 
    set the theme.
  - A few more themes added, others edited.
  - Fix for /join, which was passing the new room for both the first
    and second parameters of the NEWROOM server command.
  - Further tweaks for line wrapping logic in the client.
  - Further tweaks for partial packet correction in the bridge.
  - Fix for sendPacket returning an invalid error code on failure when
    using SSL in the bridge.
  - Blinking chat input cursor is now a shaded block, instead of an 
    underscore. Hopefully more obvious to the user that's where the input 
    line is.
  

v092 - November 30, 2025:

  Changes:

  - Basic theme options added. Themes are standard ANSI files 
    containing 2 lines and can be edited by the sysop.
  - Added a timestamp and retry counter to umrc-bridge as visual 
    feedback for the sysop.
  - Improved receipt of inbound data in umrc-bridge in SSL mode, 
    greatly reducing partial packets.
  - Chatter default display name suffix simplified to one character,
    instead of a string of alphas based on the BBS name.
  - Fixed an issue where displaying time warnings in the main 
    menu would crash umrc-client.
  - Scrollback scrolling optimizations.
  - Fixed an issue with setup that would cause input to loop
    endlessly. Also changed the default values for website and
    SSH to "NONE".
  - Fixed an issue where topic lines of certain lengths would
    cause the umrc-client to crash when joining a room.
  - General code cleanup.


 
v091 - November 28, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - umrc-bridge will attempt to reconnect to the MRC host if the 
    connection drops (up to 10 times). Upon successful reconnect,
    any users logged in will be notified.


v090 - November 26, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - Fixed issues with chat message display timing.
  - Reworked mention handling.


v002 - November 25, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - PGUP/PGDN keys now work in remote door mode as well as local mode.
  - Timeout warning messages are now shown in the chat window
    instead of overlapping into the status & input area.
  - Room & topic line now clears entirely whenever the topic changes.
         

v001 - November 23, 2025:

  Initial working build.
