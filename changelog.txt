Change Log:

v100 - TBA

  - Added a new command line option to umrc-bridge to set the maximum
    number of reconnection attempts: -r[x] where x is the maximum number
    of failed attempts allowed. If not set, the default is 10. Specify
    a 0 for infinite attempts.
  - Added a /nick chat command, which lets users edit their display name 
    (aka nick) without leaving chat.
  - Initial support for Linux added. Many sections of code have been 
    refactored to allow cross-compiling for both Windows and Linux.
  - Backspace and DEL keys now both act like a backspace, in order to 
    ensure compatibility across platforms.
  - Improved text input handling all throughout umrc-client.
  - Fixed an issue where laying down on the PGUP or PGDN keys for too 
    long would crash the door. This required a modification to OpenDoors
    to redefine the behavior of these keys, so going forward a customized
    version of OpenDoors will be necessary to run the door, and will be
    included in the project files and releases. This fixes a particularly
    horrible way the PGUP and PGDN keys were handled, and the responsiveness
    of these keys is now much faster as a result. Fixing this issue did also
    lead to the realization that laying on the ESC key similarly crashes the 
    door, with no fix as of yet.
  - Updated LibreSSL libraries for Windows from 2.5.5 to 4.2.1, the latest 
    available version as of this update (from October 2025).  
  - Display the "Quit to" BBS name it all its pipe code colorful glory.
  - displayMessage function now scrolls up the number of carriage returns
    that was added while wrapping the message.
  - Fixed pipe-code color to ANSI translation for strings containing dim 
    colors immediately after background colors.
  - Fix for incoming and outgoing /ctcp commands.
  - New "anet" themes contibuted by StingRay!
  

v099b - December 10, 2025:

  - Further line wrapping adjustments.
  - Fixed a line wrapping issue while displaying long unbroken messages in
    scrollback.
  - Added a missing end-parenthesis for /t /msg DirectMsgs.
  - Fixed casing of auto-completed user names (using the tab key).


Change Log:

v099 - December 9, 2025:

  - Added a dark gray row of dots to the bottom of the screen, to make the 
    input line slightly more obvious.
  - Fix for changing colors with left/right while typing past the screen width.
  - Nonalphanumeric characters are stripped from the sysop name before being 
    passed over to the host in the BBSMETA packet.
  - Option T is no longer visible on the main menu, but it's still a valid
    selection. Changed the verbiage to instruct users to include the info when
    submitting an issue.
  - Removed WildCat! from the BBS_TYPES in the setup program.
  - Added logic so that the "%s has disconnected." string only gets sent to the
    host if the user has not logged off cleanly. In other words, this string
    should only get sent by the bridge in the event that the user drops carrier,
    or something else unexpected happened to terminate their session. It's not 
    needed if their exit was already announced.
  - Added an extra gray dash - in front of the default join and exit messages,
    to keep them consistent with other systems.
  - Clear both the room and topic strings when leaving chat.
  - Added /theme in help.txt.
  - Included two theme contributions from xbit: l33t and stars.
  

v095 - December 7, 2025:

  - Shortened the displayable text input area by one character, as it was
    causing some terminals to drag it up the screen while typing strings
    longer than the terminal width.    
  - Fix for NOTME messages announcing users joining rooms the user is not
    in.


v094 - December 6, 2025:

  Changes:
  
  - Fixed some nasty text input issues that happen when % symbols appear
    in the chat text or input text, or when cycling through colors for 
    lines longer than the input area.
  - Basic errors written to a log file named "umrc.log".
  - Optional verbose logging can be enabled in umrc-bridge with -V command
    line switch.
  - Reset mention counter to 0 when user leaves chat.
  - Fix for messages not getting line-wrapped while chat is paused in 
    scrollback mode.
  

v093 - December 5, 2025:

  Changes:
        
  - Added /theme chat command. User types /theme by itself to list the 
    available themes, or includes the name of theme as a parameter to 
    set the theme.
  - A few more themes added, others edited.
  - Fix for /join, which was passing the new room for both the first
    and second parameters of the NEWROOM server command.
  - Further tweaks for line wrapping logic in the client.
  - Further tweaks for partial packet correction in the bridge.
  - Fix for sendPacket returning an invalid error code on failure when
    using SSL in the bridge.
  - Blinking chat input cursor is now a shaded block, instead of an 
    underscore. Hopefully more obvious to the user that's where the input 
    line is.
  

v092 - November 30, 2025:

  Changes:

  - Basic theme options added. Themes are standard ANSI files 
    containing 2 lines and can be edited by the sysop.
  - Added a timestamp and retry counter to umrc-bridge as visual 
    feedback for the sysop.
  - Improved receipt of inbound data in umrc-bridge in SSL mode, 
    greatly reducing partial packets.
  - Chatter default display name suffix simplified to one character,
    instead of a string of alphas based on the BBS name.
  - Fixed an issue where displaying time warnings in the main 
    menu would crash umrc-client.
  - Scrollback scrolling optimizations.
  - Fixed an issue with setup that would cause input to loop
    endlessly. Also changed the default values for website and
    SSH to "NONE".
  - Fixed an issue where topic lines of certain lengths would
    cause the umrc-client to crash when joining a room.
  - General code cleanup.


 
v091 - November 28, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - umrc-bridge will attempt to reconnect to the MRC host if the 
    connection drops (up to 10 times). Upon successful reconnect,
    any users logged in will be notified.


v090 - November 26, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - Fixed issues with chat message display timing.
  - Reworked mention handling.


v002 - November 25, 2025:

  Fixes:

  - PGUP/PGDN keys now work in remote door mode as well as local mode.
  - Timeout warning messages are now shown in the chat window
    instead of overlapping into the status & input area.
  - Room & topic line now clears entirely whenever the topic changes.
         

v001 - November 23, 2025:

  Initial working build.
